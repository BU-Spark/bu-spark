# UI/UX Tech Stack

We have selected tools that we wish all projects to utilize. This is not a set list, if you think another tool would better fit your project or allow you better creativity then please reach out to your respective staff advisor and propose this. We want to work with you -- but if you don't have a strong preference we will ask that you leverage our standard options.

## Design Choice

We have selected Figma as our choice of design software. We have an education account that gives us access to the professional version for more features etc. All your design files should be within a project that is owned by BU Spark!. As the UI/UX designer you should receive an invite to the project where you can access, create and edit existing work. At no point should you create and store designs on your personal Figma account.

## UI Kits

We highly recommend the use of design kits when designing prototypes. This will streamline your design process and allow our internal team to handoff your work efficiently. A UI kit is a set of reusable elements that adhere to industry guidelines. These elements integrate UX components and branding with standardized design principles, enabling companies to achieve uniform visual design across different scales and teams. Below is a list of figma-based design kits we support. If there are other design kits or systems you prefer, please speak with the staff advisors.
