# Compute Resources

Spark! has several compute resources available for student projects. Student's should not be creating hosted resources on their own personal accounts(AWS, GCP etc) instead they should use the Spark! accounts unless specifically told otherwise by Spark! staff.

# Resources Offered

## AWS Resources

We can provide most resources available on AWS including EC2(virtual machines), hosted databases etc.

## Google Cloud Platform(GCP)

Similar to AWS we can offer most resources in GCP.

## Github Pages

If you just need to deploy your static website Github pages is the the simplest option.

## Shared Computing Cluster (SCC)

The SCC is a service offered by BU that gives you access to a GPUs and CPUs for running long running tasks such as machine learning or other data intensive projects. Want to know more about the SCC? Check out [their site](https://scc-ondemand.bu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard) and [their docs](https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/system-usage/connect-scc/scc-ondemand/).

For Data Science and Machine Learning related projects, this is the preferred environment.

## Other

We do have some other random resources. If you don't see what you need, reach out to us and we can help you out!

# How to request access

In order to request access to resources please do the following:

1. Open an issue on your project's Github Repository with the following structure:

    Title:

        Request for Spark! Tech Resources for [your project name]

    Content:

        - Names + emails of all team members who need access
        - Detailed list of resources needed
        - A complete description on how you plan to use the resources
        - List any relevant course deadlines
2. Assign the appropriate person to the issue:
   - For Software Engineering related projects
      - Assign the created issue to @IanSaucy on Github
      - Send an email to <sparkeng at bu dot edu> with a link to the Github Issue. You should copy both your PM and course instructor on this email as well. This email is required.
   - For Data Science or Machine Learning related projects
      - Assign the created issue to @mvoong18 on Github
      - Send an email to <mvoong at bu dot edu> with a link to the Github Issue. You should copy both your PM and course instructor on this email as well. This email is required.
3. Future correspondence should happen through the Github Issue
