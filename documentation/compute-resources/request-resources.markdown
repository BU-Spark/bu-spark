# Compute Resources

Spark! has several compute resources available for student projects. Student's should not be creating hosted resources on their own personal accounts(AWS, GCP etc) instead they should use the Spark! accounts unless specifically told otherwise by Spark! staff. 

# Resources Offered

## AWS Resources

We can provide most resources available on AWS including EC2(virtual machines), hosted databases etc. 

## Google Cloud Platform(GCP)

Similar to AWS we can offer most resources in GCP.

## Heroku

Heroku is a great option if you need to deploy your website or backend. We can add you to our paid account.

## Github Pages

If you just need to deploy your static website Github pages is the the simplest option.

## Shared Computing Cluster (SCC)

The SCC is a service offered by BU that gives you access to a GPUs and CPUs for running long running tasks such as machine learning or other data intensive projects.

## Other

We do have some other random resources. If you don't see what you need, reach out to us and we can help you out!
