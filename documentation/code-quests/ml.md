# Machine Learning Main Quest: Coming Soon

Machine learning is a system or branch of Artificial Intelligence within Computer Science that focuses on teaching computers to make predictions, create descriptions, and prescribe certain methods of action without being explicitly told to do so (The computer in a way is being trained by means of analyzing historical data to act on its own). Some examples of machine learning algorithms include Neural Networks (models inspired by the human brain that analyze data via layers of linked nodes), Clustering (grouping data points together based on similar characteristics), and Decision Trees (models that split data into branches based on decision rules to reach a prediction or classification).

### Level One: 
→ Instructions shown below.
### Level Two: 
→ A beginner machine-learning challenge for practicing model building and evaluation on a real-world dataset.You can accept the assignment [<u>here</u>](https://classroom.github.com/a/pjAJqyVR). 
### Level Three: 
→ Creating your own project. The instructions can be found [<u>here</u>](https://github.com/BU-Spark-Learning-Ambassadors/ML-level-3).
