# Data Prep & Visualization Main Quest: Coming Soon

Data preparation is the crucial first step in the data analysis process. It involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data so it can be analyzed effectively. Think of it as tidying up a messy room—before you can find anything useful, you need to get things in order. This might include handling missing data, removing outliers, or converting categorical data into a numerical format.

Data visualization, on the other hand, is all about making sense of the data by creating visual representations like charts, graphs, and maps. It’s like turning a complex story into a picture book—easier to understand and much more engaging. Visualization helps you see patterns, trends, and outliers that might not be obvious from raw data.
