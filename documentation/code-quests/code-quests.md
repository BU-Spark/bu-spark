Need an easy, structured way to learn important tools and platforms necessary for your tech career or projects? Look no further than code quests!

Designed to strengthen your skills, Code Quests offer hands-on experience with key frameworks and concepts often missed in traditional learning.

Code quests are made up of **three levels** to ensure complete understanding of each topic:
  
### Level One: LEARN 📚
Level one consists of a document and short quiz.

### Level Two: APPLY ✏️
Level two is a Google Classroom link to a small fill-in-the-blank style exercise!

### Level Three: CREATE ✨
Level three is a project! Your work is to be submitted to Learning Ambassadors for each level in order to receive your badge.
