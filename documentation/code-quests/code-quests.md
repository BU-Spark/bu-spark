Need an easy, structured way to learn important tools and platforms necessary for your tech career or projects? Look no further than code quests!

Designed to strengthen your skills, Code Quests offer hands-on experience with key frameworks and concepts often missed in traditional learning.

Code quests are made up of **three levels** to service complete understanding of each topic:

<div style="display:grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 300px; gap:24px; align-items:start;">
  <div>
  
### Level One: LEARN
Level one consists of a document and short quiz.

### Level Two: APPLY
Level two is a Google Classroom link to a small fill-in-the-blank style exercise!

### Level Three: CREATE
Level three is a project! Your work is to be submitted to Learning Ambassadors for each level in order to receive your badge.
