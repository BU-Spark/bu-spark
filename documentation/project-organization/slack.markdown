# Slack Channel Naming

Slack channels are used for different purposes and the name of those channels should consistently reflect the usage for that channel. As a result, we have adopted the following convention:

`[i-]<season><2 digit year>-<project>-[mgmt/inst]`

## Explanation
* angle brackets (`<>`) mean the information needs to be fillled in but is required
* square brackets (`[]`)  mean that the information is optional but is literal
* `[i-]` -- indictates that the channel is *internal* and *only* the project team no third parties (like partners)
* `<season>` -- one of `s`, `f`, `su` to indicate when the project is taking place
* `<2 digit year>` -- the year in two digits
* `<project>` -- name of the project, preferably as short as reasonable
* `[mgmt]` -- optional, should include only Spark! staff, PMs, and TEs. May include EIRs and Mentors
* `[inst]` -- optional, should include only instructors and, at the instructor's discretion, others


## Examples:

* `internal-F22-myproj`
* `internal-F22-myproj-management`
* `F22-myproj`
* `internal-SP22-myproj-instructors`
