# Slack Channel Naming

Slack channels are used for different purposes and the name of those channels should consistently reflect the usage for that channel. As a result, we have adopted the following convention:

`[i-]<season><2 digit year>-[type]-<project>-[mgmt/inst]`

## Explanation
* angle brackets (`<>`) mean the information needs to be fillled in but is required
* square brackets (`[]`)  mean that the information is optional but is literal
* `[i-]` -- indictates that the channel is *internal* and *only* the project team no third parties (like partners)
* `<season>` -- one of `sp`, `fa`, `sum` to indicate when the project is taking place
* `<2 digit year>` -- the year in two digits
* `[type]` -- This is an optional field but should be used if the project does have a type. Possible options are, `ds`(Data Science), `se`(Software Engineering), `ml`(Machine Learning), `ux` (UI/UX), and `xcc`(CoLabs/XCCs).
* `<project>` -- name of the project or class, preferably as short as reasonable
* `[mgmt]` -- optional, should include only Spark! staff, PMs, and TEs. May include EIRs and Mentors
* `[inst]` -- optional, should include only instructors and, at the instructor's discretion, others


## Examples:

* `i-fa22-myproj`
* `i-fa22-myproj-mgmt`
* `fa22-myproj`
* `i-sp22-myproj-inst`
