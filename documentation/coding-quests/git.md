# Git 🗃️ ⚛

Git is a widely used version control system that helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate efficiently, and manage project history. Originally created by Linus Torvalds for Linux development, Git enables branching, merging, and distributed workflows, making it essential for open-source and team-based projects. With Git, developers can experiment with new features, roll back to previous versions, and synchronize code across multiple contributors.
